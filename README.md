## üß© Roadmap for Full Recursive Proof in zk_rollup

This project already demonstrates a working **Halo2 proof generation and verification pipeline**.  
The next major milestone is achieving a **fully recursive proof** ‚Äî a proof that *verifies another Halo2 proof inside a circuit*.  

Below is a precise checklist of what remains to reach a complete recursive setup.

---

### ‚úÖ Current Progress
- [x] Working circuits for basic computations (`fq_circuit.rs`, `ep_circuit.rs`, etc.)  
- [x] Proof generation with `create_proof`  
- [x] Verification with `verify_proof`  
- [x] Modular design separating prover, verifier, and rollup logic (`zk_rollup.rs`, `verifier_circuit.rs`)

### üöß TODO: Steps for a Real Recursive Proof

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare Inner Proof Artifacts
- [ ] Serialize the **Verifying Key (VK)** of the inner proof into field elements so it can be loaded inside a circuit.  
- [ ] Represent **public inputs** and **commitments** of the inner proof as `AssignedCell<Fr>` values.  
- [ ] Pass these serialized values into the recursive circuit as advice inputs.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build the In-Circuit Verifier Gadget
- [ ] Implement the **verifier logic inside Halo2**, reproducing the PLONK verification equation within a circuit.  
- [ ] Compute all relevant challenges (`Œ≤, Œ≥, Œ±, Œ∂`) inside the circuit.  
- [ ] Reconstruct the polynomial commitment equation and enforce it via constraints.  
- [ ] Check consistency between the in-circuit VK and the external VK of the inner proof.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Embed Previous Proofs
- [ ] Allow the recursive circuit to take one or more previous proofs as input.  
- [ ] Convert each proof‚Äôs commitments and evaluations into circuit-friendly field representations.  
- [ ] Optionally, compress these proofs for efficient embedding (e.g., hash or Merkle inclusion).

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Proof Aggregation
- [ ] Create an **accumulator gadget** to combine multiple proofs into a single set of commitments (MSM-based or linear combination).  
- [ ] Ensure the accumulator output can be verified by the next recursive layer.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Final Verification Layer
- [ ] Generate a new proof from the recursive circuit.  
- [ ] Verify that proof externally using the standard Halo2 verifier (`verify_proof`).  
- [ ] This final verification closes the recursion ‚Äî one proof validates all previous ones.

### üß† Notes
- Recursive verification requires both **field serialization** and **circuit-safe VK encoding** ‚Äî see how Zcash‚Äôs Halo2 recursive verifier handles this.  
- Modularizing the verifier gadget as its own module (e.g., `recursive_verifier.rs`) will make it easier to reuse and test.  
- Once implemented, the project will support **true proof aggregation**, enabling zk-rollup batch verification.
